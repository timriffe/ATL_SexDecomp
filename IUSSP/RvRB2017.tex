\item Estimate empirical TTD profiles for different disabilities (USA HRS, 1905-1930 cohorts)
\item Convert TTD profiles to $\pi_x$ using HMD lifetables
\item Assume all populations stationary
\item Decompose pairwise ULE differences between all populations (1980, 1990, 2000) into \emph{mortality} and \emph{morbidity} components
\item Same for within-population changes over 10-year periods, 1950-2010
\item (By design, all ULE differences due 100\% to mortality)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item If $e_{60}$ increases by 5 years, up to 1 year of decrease in ULE attributed to disability component could be from decrease in mortality (Female ADL 3+)
\item Different slopes partly from differences in final $\pi_x$ between
disability types and the sexes

% Conclusion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[plain]
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\Large
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item TTD prevalence can result from age-patterned transitions (incidence)
\item Modeling prevalence as TTD requires no specification of process
\item Morbidity varies over both age and time-to-death
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[plain]
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\Large
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item HLE (ULE) important health metrics
\item Difficult to properly interpret period differences 
\item Age patterns of disability can change due to mortality, even if TTD prevalence held constant (dynamic equilibria re Klijs et al. 2011)
\item Could partly explain why mortality levels and disability prevalence are related (Van Oyen et al. 2013, Luy and Minagawa 2014)
\end{itemize}
