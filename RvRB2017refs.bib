  Abstract                 = {{H}ealth trends in the fastest growing sector of the population, the oldest old, have received much attention during the past decade because of the rising costs of medical and long-term care. {M}any studies have suggested a compression of morbidity in this sector, implying that the future care needs of elderly people will not follow the demographic prognoses. {M}ost of these studies have used health indicators based on disability, a concept that is contextually embedded. {W}e have taken a closer look at health-trend surveys with a focus on the health indicator used. {O}ur findings reveal that although disability measures often show improvement, there is a simultaneous increase in chronic disease and functional impairments�health components that require care resources. {T}hat is, an expansion of other health problems may accompany a compression of disability. {T}herefore, a concept of general morbidity is not sufficient when discussing health trends and the need for care services in the elderly population. {B}ecause different indicators do not show the same trends over time, we suggest a more refined discussion that distinguishes between different health components. {I}n addition, different components have different implications for the amount and kind of care resources needed. {I}f the current positive trends in disability continue, future need for social services and long-term care may not parallel demographic projections. {T}rends in disease and functional limitations seem to have taken a different direction, suggesting a parallel or increased need for resources in medical care, rehabilitation, and compensatory interventions such as assistive technology.},
