	status ({SES}), measured using occupation, and self-reported health,
	and to examine the contribution of various material, occupational
	and psychosocial factors to social inequalities in health in {E}urope.{M}ethods
	{T}his study was based on data from the {E}uropean {Q}uality of {L}ife
	{S}urvey ({EQLS}) carried out in 2003. {T}he total sample consisted
	of 6038 and 6383 working men and women in 28 countries in {E}urope
	(response rates: 30.3{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ91.2%). {E}ach set of potential material,
	occupational and psychosocial mediators included between eight and
	11 variables. {S}tatistical analysis was performed using multilevel
	logistic regression analysis.{R}esults {S}ignificant social differences
	were observed for self-reported health, manual workers being more
	likely to be in poor health ({OR}=1.89, 95% {CI} 1.46 to 2.46 for
	men, {OR}=2.18, 95% {CI} 1.71 to 2.77 for women). {S}trong social
	gradients were found for almost all potential mediating factors,
	and almost all displayed significant associations with self-reported
	health. {S}ocial differences in health were substantially reduced
	after adjustment for material, occupational and psychosocial factors,
	with material factors playing a major role. {T}he four strongest
	contributions to reducing these differences were found for material
	deprivation, social exclusion, financial problems and job reward.
	{T}aking all mediators into account led to an explanation of the
	social differences in health by 78{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ100% for men and women.{C}onclusion
	{T}he association between {SES} and poor health may be attributed
	to differential distributions of several dimensions of material,
	occupational and psychosocial conditions across occupational groups.
	{I}nterventions targeting different dimensions might result in a
	reduction in social inequalities in health.},

	inequality is long. {T}he way in which health inequality has customarily
	been documented is by comparing differences in the average health
	across groups, for example, by sex or gender, income, education,
	occupation, or geographic region. {I}n the controversial {W}orld
	{H}ealth {R}eport 2000, researchers at the {W}orld {H}ealth {O}rganization
	criticized this traditional practice and proposed to measure health
	inequality across individuals irrespective of individualsâ€™ group
	affiliation. {T}hey defended its proposal on the moral grounds without
	clear explanation. {I}n this paper {I} ask: is health inequality
	across individuals of moral concern, and, if so, why? {C}larification
	of these questions is crucial for meaningful interpretation of health
	inequality measured across individuals. {O}nly if there was something
	morally problematic in health inequality across individuals, its
	reduction would be good news. {S}pecifically, in this paper {I} provide
	three arguments for the moral significance of health inequality across
	individuals: (a) health is special, (b) health equity plays an important
	and unique role in the general pursuit of justice, and (c) health
	inequality is an indicator of general injustice in society. {I} then
	discuss three key questions to examine the validity of these arguments:
	(i) how special is health?, (ii) how good is health as an indicator?,
	and (iii) what do we mean by injustice? {I} conclude that health
	inequality across individuals is of moral interest with the arguments

	quality of life ({HRQL}) in the assessment of population health.
	{T}he objective of this study is to assess the health of {A}mericans
	in the 1990s by describing the average {HRQL} and its inequality
	across individuals and groups.{METHODS}:{T}his study uses the 1990
	and 1995 {N}ational {H}ealth {I}nterview {S}urvey from the {U}nited
	{S}tates. {T}he measure of {HRQL} is the {H}ealth and {A}ctivity
	{L}imitation {I}ndex ({HAL}ex). {T}he measure of health inequality
	across individuals is the {G}ini coefficient. {T}his study provides
	confidence intervals ({CI}) for the {G}ini coefficient by a bootstrap
	method. {T}o describe health inequality by group, this study decomposes
	the overall {G}ini coefficient into the between-group, within-group,
	and overlap {G}ini coefficient using race ({W}hite, {B}lack, and
	other) as an example. {T}his study looks at how much contribution
	the overlap {G}ini coefficient makes to the overall {G}ini coefficient,
	in addition to the absolute mean differences between groups.{RESULTS}:{T}he
	average {HAL}ex was the same in 1990 (0.87, 95% {CI}: 0.87, 0.88)
	and 1995 (0.87, 95% {CI}: 0.86, 0.87). {T}he {G}ini coefficient for
	the {HAL}ex distribution across individuals was greater in 1995 (0.097,
	95% {CI}: 0.096, 0.099) than 1990 (0.092, 95% {CI}: 0.091, 0.094).
	{D}ifferences in the average {HAL}ex between all racial groups were
	the same in 1995 as 1990. {T}he contribution of the overlap to the
	overall {G}ini coefficient was greater in 1995 than in 1990 by 2.4%.
	{I}n both years, inequality between racial groups accounted only
	for 4-5% of overall inequality.{CONCLUSION}:{T}he average {HRQL}
	of {A}mericans was the same in 1990 and 1995, but inequality in {HRQL}
	across individuals was greater in 1995 than 1990. {I}nequality in
	{HRQL} by race was smaller in 1995 than 1990 because race had smaller

	impact of poverty on health. {M}any studies also fail to address
	the possibility of reverse causation; poor health causes low income.
	{T}his paper aims to address these issues by moving beyond the static
	perspective provided by cross-sectional analyses and focusing on
	the dynamic nature of people's experiences of income and health.

	confirm the general findings from the small number of longitudinal
	studies available in the international literature: long-term income
	is more important for health than current income; income levels are
	more significant than income change; persistent poverty is more harmful
	for health than occasional episodes; and, income reductions appear
	to have a greater effect on health than income increases. {A}fter

  abstract = {{D}emography is the study of the population consequences of the fates
	of individuals. {I}ndividuals are differentiated on the basis of
	age or, in general, life cycle stages. {T}he movement of an individual
	through its life cycle is a random process, and although the eventual
	destination (death) is certain, the pathways taken to that destination
	are stochastic and will differ even between identical individuals;
	this is individual stochasticity. {A} stage-classified demographic
	model contains implicit age-specific information, which can be analyzed
	using {M}arkov chain methods. {T}he living stages in the life cycles
	are transient states in an absorbing {M}arkov chain; death is an
	absorbing state. {T}his paper presents {M}arkov chain methods for
	computing the mean and variance of the lifetime number of visits
	to any transient state, the mean and variance of longevity, the net
	reproductive rate {R}0, and the cohort generation time. {I}t presents
	the matrix calculus methods needed to calculate the sensitivity and
	elasticity of all these indices to any life history parameters. {T}hese
	sensitivities have many uses, including calculation of selection
	gradients. {I}t is shown that the use of {R}0 as a measure of fitness
	or an invasion exponent gives erroneous results except when {R}0=03{BB}=1.
	{T}he {M}arkov chain approach is then generalized to variable environments
	(deterministic environmental sequences, periodic environments, iid
	random environments, {M}arkovian environments). {V}ariable environments
	are analyzed using the vec-permutation method to create a model that
	classifies individuals jointly by the stage and environmental condition.
	{T}hroughout, examples are presented using the {N}orth {A}tlantic
	right whale ({E}ubaleana glacialis) and an endangered prairie plant
	({L}omatium bradshawii) in a stochastic fire environment.},

	{T}his involves estimating a concentration index and a generalized
	concentration index for the eight-scale health profile of the {S}hort

	the concentration index is estimated with respect to health or morbidity
	has an impact on the results. {T}he ranking between the two countries
	is reversed for two of the eight dimensions of {SF}-36 and within
	both countries the ranking across the eight {SF}-36 scales is also
	affected. {H}owever, this change in ranking does not occur when the

	observed during the decade 1985-1994, as well as to calculate and
	compare the potential gains due to the partial or total elimination
	of these causes. {METHODS}: {M}ortality data from the {I}talian {M}ortality
	{D}ata {B}ase were analysed by the method of decomposition of changes
	in life expectancy and the partial multiple decrement life table
	technique. {RESULTS}: {I}n {I}taly, considering the decade 1985-1994,
	the gain in life expectancy at birth was 2.27 years for men and 2.16
	for women. {T}he major contribution to this increase was the reduction
	in {CVD} mortality followed by fewer deaths from accidents and {MN}.
	{C}onversely, {AIDS} caused a loss in the length of life of adults.
	{M}ajor potential gains in life expectancy at birth could be obtained
	by the elimination or even partial reduction of {CVD} and {MN} mortality.
	{W}hen working life (15-64 years) is considered, the relative importance
	of the causes changes. {T}he elimination of accidents and {AIDS}
	would result in increased life expectancy longer than that associated

	is often claimed that there are missing additional causes for even
	reasonably well-understood conditions such as lung cancer and coronary
	heart disease. {S}everal lines of evidence suggest that largely chance
	events, from the biographical down to the sub-cellular, contribute

	this dream. {A}n evolutionary explanation of why randomness exists
	in the development of organisms has long been articulated, in terms

	the basic notion that what is near-random at one level may be almost
	entirely predictable at a higher level is an emergent property of

	in mortality have generally relied upon occupational social class
	as the index of socioeconomic position, while in the {US}, measures
	based upon education have been widely used. {T}hese two measures
	have different characteristics; for example, social class can change
	throughout adult life, while education is unlikely to alter after
	early adulthood. {T}herefore different interpretations can be given
	to the mortality differentials that are seen. {T}he objective of
	this analysis is to demonstrate the profile of mortality differentials,
	and the factors underlying these differentials, which are associated
	with the two socioeconomic measures. {DESIGN}: {P}rospective observational
	study. {SETTING}: 27 work places in the west of {S}cotland. {PARTICIPANTS}:
	5749 men aged 35-64 who completed questionnaires and were examined
	between 1970 and 1973. {FINDINGS}: {A}t baseline, similar gradients
	between socioeconomic position and blood pressure, height, lung function,
	and smoking behaviour were seen, regardless of whether the education
	or social class measure was used. {M}anual social class and early
	termination of full time education were associated with higher blood
	pressure, shorter height, poorer lung function, and a higher prevalence
	of smoking. {W}ithin education strata, the graded association between
	smoking and social class remains strong, whereas within social class
	groups the relation between education and smoking is attenuated.
	{O}ver 21 years of follow up, 1639 of the men died. {M}ortality from
	all causes and from three broad cause of death groups (cardiovascular
	disease, malignant disease, and other causes) showed similar associations
	with social class and education. {F}or all cause of death groups,
	men in manual social classes and men who terminated full time education
	at an early age had higher death rates. {C}ardiovascular disease
	was the cause of death group most strongly associated with education,
	while the non-cardiovascular non-cancer category was the cause of
	death group most strongly associated with adulthood social class.
	{T}he graded association between social class and all cause mortality
	remains strong and significant within education strata, whereas within
	social class strata the relation between education and mortality
	is less clear. {CONCLUSIONS}: {A}s a single indicator of socioeconomic
	position occupational social class in adulthood is a better discriminator

  abstract = {{A}n investigator-independent parameter, the prolate rectangularity
	index [kappa], for describing the so-called rectangularity of biological
	population survival curves, is introduced, developed, and applied
	to realworld survival datasets. {T}his new rectangularity parameter
	is constructed using an intrinsic time scaling that places the intrinsic
	inflection point time at a value of unity so that species populations
	may be compared independently of their extrinsic life span distributions.
	{T}he analytical expressions for the prolate rectangularity index
	of the theoretical {G}ompertz and {W}eibull continuous models are
	obtained, as are numerical values of this index for discrete experimental
	population survival data sets from two dissimilar species with orders
	of magnitude difference in extrinsic life span range. {T}he values
	of the parameter are also compared for populations of a single species
	having differing dietary regimens, and for human demographic populations
	at decade intervals in extrinsic chronological time during the current
	century. {I}t is found that scaling time, using the survival inflection
	point, appreciably collapses extrinsic survival profile dispersion
	among similar populations and allows a more meaningful comparison
	of profiles among dissimilar populations. {U}sing this method of
	scaling, demographic populations within the {U}nited {S}tates are

	drifting during this century toward values indicating a higher degree

	to be stabilizing with [kappa] values indicating no approach towards
	the theoretical maximum rectangularity. {T}his apparent submaximal
	stabilization of [kappa] supports a hypothesis of no genetically
	pre-determined maximum life span in human populations. {O}r, if such

	are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term
	analysis of trends in health disparities. {A}verage life expectancy
	has steadily increased in the {U}nited {S}tates but there is limited
	information on long-term mortality trends in the {US} counties {T}his
	study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county
	mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases
	to county level mortality trends.{M}ethods and {F}indings{W}e used
	mortality statistics (from the {N}ational {C}enter for {H}ealth {S}tatistics
	&#91;NCHS&#93;) and population (from the {US} {C}ensus) to estimate
	sex-specific life expectancy for {US} counties for every year between
	1961 and 1999. {D}ata for analyses in subsequent years were not provided
	to us by the {NCHS}. {W}e calculated different metrics of cross-county
	mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether
	their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the
	national average. {W}e estimated the probability of death from specific
	diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance.
	{W}e simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county&#39;s
	life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961
	and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US
	counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and
	women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to
	2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically
	significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline
	for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983
	to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for
	men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another
	48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy
	decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased
	mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
	(COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases,
	which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular
	mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially
	to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative
	specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in
	cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration.ConclusionsThere
	was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties
	between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality
	among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased
	in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases
	related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.},

	{T}he study differs from earlier research in this field in the following
	respects. {F}irst, an attempt is made to include explanatory variables
	which have some bearing upon policy discussions. {S}econdly, considerable
	attention is devoted to the correct specification of the regression
	equation. {T}hirdly, an attempt is made to assess the sensitivity
	of the estimates to changes in (i) the composition of the sample
	and (ii) the observations on infant mortality. {F}inally, the data
	employed in the study appear to be somewhat less inaccurate than
	the figures which have been used elsewhere. {T}he most satisfactory
	empirical results are obtained from a logarithmic model, in which
	the illiteracy rate for women $({I})$, nurses per head of population
	$({N})$, physicians per head $({P})$, and the coefficient of variation
	$({V})$ - a measure of inequality of incomes - appear as explanatory
	variables. {T}he results for this model indicate that 73 per cent
	of the inter-country variation in the logarithm of the infant mortality
	rate $(\log {D})$ can be explained by differences in $\log {I}, \log
	{N}, \log {P}$ and $\log {V}$. {I}t is worth emphasizing that the
	estimated parameters of this model are found to be fairly precise
	and robust, in contrast to the results obtained in earlier studies.
	{A}n important finding which emerges from the econometric analysis
	is that the stage of economic development per se appears not to have
	a direct impact upon infant mortality. {A}nother finding of considerable
	interest is that the results fail to uphold the hypothesis that high
	fertility is a cause of high infant mortality {I}t is also worth
	mentioning that infant mortality appears to be more sensitive to
	variations in the share of the exceptionally rich than to changes
	in the share of the comparatively poor. {A}n examination of the policy
	implications of the model reveals that ${D}$ may be expected to be
	very sensitive to changes in ${I}, {P}$ and ${V}$. {I}t is concluded
	that a rapid fall in the infant mortality rates of underdeveloped
	countries will not be achieved unless greater emphasis is placed
	upon reducing inequality of incomes and augmenting the social infrastructure.},

	and the time trends in the association between municipal socioeconomic
	status ({SES}) and all-cause mortality across {J}apan from 1973 to
	1998. {S}ex-specific mortality of municipalities ({N}=3319 in 1995)
	by age groups (total, under 75-year, and over 75-year populations)
	was linked to municipal {SES} indicators related to income, education,
	unemployment and living space, and two {SES} composite indices formulated
	by principle component analysis ({I}ndex 1 related to lower income
	and education, and {I}ndex 2 related to unemployment and overcrowding).
	{T}he relation was assessed using mortality gradients by {SES} quintiles
	and {B}ayesian hierarchical {P}oisson regression. {T}he results showed
	that a lower {SES} was related to higher mortality for all {SES}
	indicators and composite indices. {T}he mortality gradient was steeper
	for the under 75-year population than the total and over 75-year
	populations, and the relation between mortality and income- and education-related
	indicators/index was stronger for males than for females. {T}he time
	trend showed an increase in the relation for {I}ndex 2, while a decrease
	for {I}ndex 1. {T}his study demonstrated that lower municipal {SES}
	had an adverse influence on population health, and the influence
	was marked for males and premature death. {A}lthough a substantial
	health disadvantage still remained in lower {SES} areas, the impact
	of {SES} factors on geographical health variation changed over time;
	the association with mortality has weakened for income and education,
	while it has strengthened for unemployment and living space.},

	status across social, economic, and other groups. {N}o study exists
	on the distribution of the risk of ill-health across individuals,
	either within groups or across all people in a society, and as such
	a crucial piece of total health inequality has been overlooked. {S}ome
	of the reason for this neglect has been that the risk of death, which
	forms the basis for most measures, is impossible to observe directly
	and difficult to estimate.{METHODS}:{W}e develop a measure of total
	health inequality - encompassing all inequalities among people in
	a society, including variation between and within groups - by adapting
	a beta-binomial regression model. {W}e apply it to children under
	age two in 50 low- and middle-income countries. {O}ur method has
	been adopted by the {W}orld {H}ealth {O}rganization and is being
	implemented in surveys around the world; preliminary estimates have
	appeared in the {W}orld {H}ealth {R}eport (2000).{RESULTS}:{C}ountries
	with similar average child mortality differ considerably in total
	health inequality. {L}iberia and {M}ozambique have the largest inequalities
	in child survival, while {C}olombia, the {P}hilippines and {K}azakhstan

	health inequality estimates should be routinely reported alongside
	average levels of health in populations and groups, as they reveal
	important policy-related information not otherwise knowable. {T}his

	the measurement of health inequality, defined as differences in health
	across individuals in the population. {W}e propose that health is
	an intrinsic component of well-being and th us we should be concerned
	with inequality in health, whether or not it is correlated with inequality
	in other dimensions of well-being. {I}n the measurement of health
	inequality, the complete range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes
	should be incorporated. {T}his notion is operationalized through
	the concept of healthy lifespan. {I}ndividual health expectancy is
	preferable, as a measurement, to individual healthy lifespan, since
	health expectancy excludes those differences in healthy lifespan
	that are simply due to chance. {I}n other words, the quantity of
	interest for studying health inequality is the distribution of health
	expectancy across individuals in the population. {T}he inequality
	of the distribution of health expectancy can be summarized by measures
	of individual/mean differences (differences between the individual
	and the mean of the population) or inter-individual differences.
	{T}he exact form of the measure to summarize inequality depends on
	three normative choices. {A} firmer understanding of people's views
	on these normative choices will provide a basis for deliberating
	on a standard {WHO} measure of health inequality.},

	to present the initial findings from a new generation of research
	that has been undertaken in response to renewed concern for health
	inequalities; and to stimulate movement for action in order to correct
	the problems identified by this research. {T}he research findings
	are presented in the five articles which follow. {T}his {C}ritical
	{R}eflection proposes two initial steps for the action needed to
	alleviate the problem; other suggestions are given by the participants
	in a {R}ound {T}able discussion which is published after these articles.
	{T}he theme section concludes with extracts from the classic writings
	of the nineteenth-century public health pioneer, {W}illiam {F}arr,
	who is widely credited as one of the founders of the scientific study
	of health inequalities, together with a commentary. {T}his {C}ritical
	{R}eflection contributes to the discussion of the action needed by
	proposing two initial steps for action. {T}hat professionals who
	give {V}ery high priority to the distinct but related objectives
	of poverty alleviation, inequality reduction, and equity enhancement
	recognize that their shared concern for the distributional aspects
	of health policy is far more important than any differences that
	may divide them. {T}hat health policy goals, currently expressed
	as societal averages, be reformulated so that they point specifically
	to conditions among the poor and to poor-rich differences. {F}or
	example, infant mortality rates among the poor or the differences
	in infant mortality between rich and poor sectors would be more useful
	indicators than the average infant mortality rates for the whole
	population.},

	in {D}enmark with that in selected {E}uropean countries, focusing
	on age groups and causes of death for which the {D}anish trends are
	particularly unfavourable. {M}ethods: {C}omparisons were made for

	{F}ederal {R}epublic of {G}ermany, {T}he {N}etherlands, the {UK},
	{F}rance, {I}taly and former {C}zechoslovakia of age-specific mortality
	rates and changes in life expectancy specific for each age group
	and cause of death. {R}esults: {A}t the end of the period only the
	former {C}zechoslovakia had a lower life expectancy than {D}enmark;
	the difference in life expectancy between {D}enmark and the other
	six countries varied between 5 and 48 months. {A}lmost all of the
	difference was due to a higher mortality rate in the 35â€“74 years
	age group. {A}ll heart diseases and â€˜symptoms and ill-defined conditionsâ€™
	were responsible for a large proportion of the {D}anish high mortality,
	the decrease in mortality from this group of diseases being moderate
	in comparison with the other countries. {L}ung cancer contributed
	to a loss of 1â€“6 months more of life expectancy for {D}anish women
	than in the other countries. {I}n comparison with {N}orway, {T}he

	study, we assess the hypothesis that individual change in the performance
	on {IQ} tests between ages 10 and 20 years is associated with mortality
	later in life.{M}ethods {T}he analyses are based on a cohort of {S}wedish
	boys born in 1928 (n{Ã}¢â‚¬â€°={Ã}¢â‚¬â€°610) for whom social background

	{S}tructural equation models were used to estimate the extent to
	which two latent intelligence scores, at ages 10 and 20 years, manifested
	by results on the {IQ} tests, are related to paternal and own education,
	and how all these variables are linked to all-cause mortality.{R}esults
	{I}ntelligence at the age of 20 years was associated with lower mortality

	lost ({YPLL}) due to these causes in measuring the impact of premature
	death for the {US} population of working age (15-64 years). {METHODS}:
	{T}he {PGLE} and the {YPLL} were computed from mortality reports
	(1987-1992) by race and gender group for deaths from {HIV}/{AIDS},
	diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms for the {US} population
	of working age. {RESULTS}: {T}he {YPLL} overestimated the importance
	of premature deaths from {HIV}/{AIDS} compared to the {PGLE}. {F}or
	the total {US} population and total {US} white population of working

	the {YPLL} were about 20-30% lower than the {PGLE} for the {US} black
	population of working age. {F}urthermore the relative importance
	of the impact of death from various diseases may be interchanged
	by these two indicators. {F}or example, for {US} black males of working
	age, the impact of deaths from {HIV}/{AIDS} by {PGLE} in 1992 was
	higher than that from malignant neoplasms and lower than that from
	diseases of the heart, but by using {YPLL}, the impact of premature
	deaths from {HIV}/{AIDS} was higher than that from both diseases
	of the heart and malignant neoplasms. {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he {PGLE}
	by elimination of deaths from diseases takes into account the competing
	risks on the population and it can be compared easily across populations.
	{T}he {YPLL} is an index that does not take into account competing
	risks and it is also heavily influenced by the age structure and
	total population size. {A}lthough there are several standardization
	techniques proposed to improve the comparability of the {YPLL} across
	different populations, the {YPLL} fails to address the central issue
	of competing risks operating on the population. {F}or this reason,
	we prefer the {PGLE} to the {YPLL} in measuring the impact of premature
	deaths on a population.},

	experienced major changes in political, economic, and social realities.
	{W}e aimed to analyse mortality changes by education from 1989 to
	2000 in order to assess the impact of recent changes in {E}stonia,
	as well as the delayed effects of pre-transitional developments.
	{M}ethods {T}wo census-based analyses were compared. {I}ndividual
	cause-specific death data for those aged 20+ for 1987-1990 (72 003
	deaths) and 1999-2000 (35 477 deaths) came from the national mortality
	database. {P}opulation denominators came from the population censuses
	of 1989 and 2000. {M}ortality for all causes combined and for selected
	causes of death were analysed for high, mid, and low educational
	groups. {T}he absolute differences in mortality were evaluated through
	life expectancy at age 25 and age-standardized mortality rates. {T}o
	assess the relative differences between educational levels, mortality
	rate ratios with 95% {CI} were calculated using {P}oisson regression.
	{R}esults {E}ducational differences in mortality increased tremendously
	from 1989 to 2000: over the 10-year period life expectancy improved
	considerably for graduates, and worsened for those with the lowest
	education. {I}n 2000, male graduates aged 25 could expect to live
	13.1 years longer than corresponding men with the lowest education;
	among women the difference was 8.6 years. {L}arge differences were
	observed in all selected causes of death in 1989 and in 2000 and
	the trends were invariably much more favourable for the higher educated.
	{E}ducational differences in total mortality increased in all age
	groups. {C}onclusions {S}ocial disruption and increasing inequalities
	in wealth can be considered main recent determinants; however, causal
	processes, shaped decades before recent reforms, also contribute
	to this widening gap.},

	mid-19th century, and suggests continuities in suggested explanations
	for these, a particularly persistent thread being debates between
	environmentalists, hereditarians, and those emphasising personal

	models for inequalities in health (artefact, selection, behavioural
	and materialist), points out that the working group rejected the

	the "soft" version of the last, and suggests that the rather polarised
	debate about these explanations that followed can be understood in
	the light of the contemporary political context and a tendency to
	confuse the "hard" and "soft" versions. {M}ethodological and empirical

	the ubiquity of socio-economic differentials across industrialised

	avoid disease risks no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any
	given time. {T}o test this theory we compared the magnitude of inequalities
	in mortality between more and less preventable causes of death in
	19 {E}uropean populations, and assessed whether inequalities in mortality
	from preventable causes are larger in countries with larger resource
	inequalities. {W}e collected and harmonized mortality data by educational
	level on 19 national and regional populations from 16 {E}uropean
	countries in the first decade of the 21st century. {W}e calculated
	age-adjusted {R}elative {R}isks of mortality among men and women
	aged 30â€“79 for 24 causes of death, which were classified into four
	groups: amenable to behavior change, amenable to medical intervention,
	amenable to injury prevention, and non-preventable. {A}lthough an
	overwhelming majority of {R}elative {R}isks indicate higher mortality
	risks among the lower educated, the strength of the educationâ€“mortality
	relation is highly variable between causes of death and populations.
	{I}nequalities in mortality are generally larger for causes amenable
	to behavior change, medical intervention and injury prevention than
	for non-preventable causes. {T}he contrast between preventable and
	non-preventable causes is large for causes amenable to behavior change,

	{T}he contrast between preventable and non-preventable causes is

	who were economically active and 40-60 year-olds at the time of data
	collection. {W}e measured perceived health and physical functioning
	({SF}-36 physical component summary) with standardized health questionnaires.
	{T}he results obtained here reconfirm the similarity of the patterns
	of ill-health of those with lower socioeconomic status among non-manual
	men and women in {B}ritain and {F}inland. {T}hese data also provide
	good evidence for a socioeconomic gradient in ill-health among {J}apanese
	non-manual men, although this gradient was less systematic. {F}or
	{J}apanese men poorer health of manual workers as compared to non-manual
	workers was well demonstrated. {H}owever, among {J}apanese women
	socioeconomic differences in health were small and inconsistent.
	{I}n conclusion, {B}ritain, {F}inland and {J}apan--representing [`]liberal',
	[`]{N}ordic' and [`]conservative' welfare state regimes--produce
	broadly similar patterns of socioeconomic differences in health among
	men. {H}owever, different patterns of labour force participation
	and welfare provision in different welfare regimes may bring about
	different patterns of socioeconomic differences in health for working
	women. {T}his is exemplified by the lack of health inequalities among
	employed {J}apanese women.},

	in {F}inland among all over 35 year old men and women. {B}aseline
	social class (manual/non-manual) was from the 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985
	and 1990 census records, and follow up was by computerised record
	linkage to death certificates for 1971{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ1995.{MAIN} {RESULTS}
	{F}rom the early 1970s to the early 1990s life expectancy at age
	35 increased by about five and four years among {F}innish men and
	women respectively, with largest gains among 55{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ74 year
	old men and 65{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ84 year old women. {L}ife expectancy increase
	was 5.1 years among non-manual and 3.8 years among manual men; corresponding
	figures for women were 3.6 and 3.0 years. {I}n the 1980s, when differences
	in life expectancy increased most rapidly, decline in cardiovascular
	disease mortality was more rapid in the non-manual than the manual
	class. {F}urthermore, increasing mortality for alcohol associated
	causes, {Ã}¢â‚¬{Å}“other diseases{Ã}¢â‚¬{Â}?, and accidents and violence
	were most prominent in the manual class.{CONCLUSIONS} {E}xplanations
	of increasing social inequalities in mortality that are based on
	one underlying factor are difficult to reconcile with the variability
	in the cause specific trends in social inequalities in mortality.
	{T}he contribution of older ages to social inequalities in mortality
	should be more widely recognised.},

	inactivity (400 000 deaths; 16.6%), and alcohol consumption (85 000

	to explore the causes of the disparities that can inform specific
	public health intervention policies and programs.{M}ethods and {F}indings{T}he
	eight {A}mericas were defined based on race, location of the county

	capita income, and cumulative homicide rate. {D}ata sources for population
	and mortality figures were the {B}ureau of the {C}ensus and the {N}ational
	{C}enter for {H}ealth {S}tatistics. {W}e estimated life expectancy,
	the risk of mortality from specific diseases, health insurance, and
	health-care utilization for the eight {A}mericas. {T}he life expectancy
	gap between the 3.4 million high-risk urban black males and the 5.6
	million {A}sian females was 20.7 y in 2001. {W}ithin the sexes, the

	explained by race, income, or basic health-care access and utilization
	alone. {B}ecause policies aimed at reducing fundamental socioeconomic
	inequalities are currently practically absent in the {US}, health

	a more refined discussion that distinguishes between different health

  abstract = {{A} very simple technique has been used to shed light on a number
	of questions about the influence of economic level on national mortality
	trends and differentials. {S}catter-diagrams of the cross-sectional
	relation between national income per head and life expectancy are
	developed for three decades during the twentieth century. {T}he relations
	established appear to shift systematically during the century. {I}n
	general, in order to attain a certain life expectancy between 40
	and 60, a nation requires an income level almost three times greater
	in the 1930s than in the 1960s. {T}his shift is corroborated by a
	changing structure of mortality by cause of death for populations
	at equivalent mortality levels. {T}he magnitude of the shifts, combined
	with regional income data, suggests that some 75-90 per cent of the
	growth in life expectancy for the world as a whole over these three
	decades is attributable to factors exogenous to a nation's contemporary
	level of income. {T}hrough similar techniques, improved nutrition
	and higher literacy can also be ruled out as important contributors.
	{N}evertheless, the cross-sectional relation between income and life
	expectancy remains strong, and there is some suggestion that mortality
	is now more responsive to variations in income levels among countries
	with national incomes below $400 (1963 dollars) than it was in the
	1930s. {H}owever, population size appears to respond so slowly to
	the mortality declines that typically result from income growth that
	these mortality effects present little impediment to the process
	of economic development. {S}ome of the variability in the cross-sectional
	mortality-income relation is doubtless due to variation in income
	distributions. {L}ife expectancy in {V}enezuela, {M}exico, and {C}olumbia,
	countries with wide disparities in incomes, falls short of levels
	expected on the basis of their mean incomes. {O}n the other hand,
	life expectancy in {S}oviet-bloc countries, where income equality
	is expected to be greater than average, also falls short of expected
	levels. {W}estern and non-{W}estern countries alike profited from
	the activity of `exogenous' medical and public health factors. {D}ifferences
	between the two types of countries have been exaggerated by concentration
	on movements between equivalent mortality levels rather than during
	equivalent time periods. {R}ecent work in historical demography suggests
	that the importance in {W}estern mortality trends of endogenous factors
	consequent to rising standards of living has been overstated for
	earlier periods as well.},

  abstract = {{M}odel patterns of the cause structure of mortality at different
	levels were established for males and females, based on data for
	165 national populations. {T}hese patterns suggest that the cause
	of death most responsible for mortality variation is influenza/bronchitis,
	followed by `other infectious and parasitic diseases', respiratory
	tuberculosis, and diarrhoeal disease. {T}ogether, these causes typically
	account for about 60 per cent of the change in level of mortality
	from all causes combined. {T}heir respective contributions have not
	depended in an important way on the initial level of mortality. {T}hese
	results - especially the importance of the respiratory and diarrhoeal
	diseases - imply that past accounts may have over-emphasized the
	role in mortality decline of specific and well-defined infectious
	diseases and their corresponding methods of control. {T}here is strong
	statistical support for the suggestion that most of the remainder
	of mortality variation should be ascribed to changes in cardio-vascular
	diseases, but that methods of cause-of-death assignment in high-mortality
	populations have often obscured the importance of these diseases.
	{W}hen death rates from `other and unknown' causes are held constant,
	changes in cardio-vascular disease account for about one-quarter
	of the decline in mortality from `all causes'. {A}lthough the causal
	factors are poorly established, corroborative results have been demonstrated
	cross-sectionally in the {U}nited {S}tates. {T}he composition of
	the group of populations most deviant from the structural norms is
	apparently dominated by differentials in the mode of assigning deaths
	to cardio-vascular disease. {H}owever, when broad groups of regions
	or periods are distinguished, more subtle differences emerge. {C}ontrolling
	mortality level for all causes combined, diarrhoeal diseases are
	significantly higher in non-{W}estern populations and southern/eastern
	{E}urope than in overseas {E}urope or northern/western {E}urope.
	{T}hese differences are probably related to standards of nutrition
	and personal hygiene, but may also reflect climatic factors. {M}uch
	higher cardio-vascular mortality in overseas {E}uropean populations
	than in non-{W}estern populations at similar overall levels probably
	reflects variation in habits of life. {R}egional differences in death
	rates from violence, maternal mortality, respiratory tuberculosis
	and influenza/pneumonia/bronchitis are briefly noted and commented
	upon. {C}ause-of-death structures at a particular level of mortality
	display some important changes over time. {R}espiratory tuberculosis
	and `other infectious and parasitic diseases' have tended to contribute
	less and less to a certain level of mortality. {T}hey have in part
	been `replaced' by diarrhoeal disease, specifically in non-{W}estern
	populations. {T}hese developments reflect an accelerating rate of
	medical and public health progress against the specific infectious
	diseases, and a disappointing rate of progress against diarrhoeal
	disease. {W}estern and non-western populations have shared to approximately
	the same extent in the accelerating progress against infectious diseases,
	and developments during the post-war period are more appropriately
	viewed as an extension of prior trends rather than as radical departures
	therefrom. {F}or males, cardio-vascular disease and cancer have significantly
	increased their contribution to a particular level of mortality,
	while no such tendency is apparent for females. {T}hese developments
	may be related to changes in personal behaviour and in environmental
	influences whose differential impact on the sexes has been demonstrated
	in epidemiological studies. {A}lthough we have avoided an explicit
	treatment of age by having recourse at the outset to standardization,
	certain of the results are apparently reflected in studies of age
	patterns of mortality. {T}he joint occurrence in non-{W}estern populations
	and {S}outhern/{E}astern populations of exceptionally high death
	rates from diarrhoeal disease may explain why the `{S}outh' age-pattern,
	with it high death rates between ages one and five, is often the
	most accurate referent for use in {L}atin {A}merica and {A}sia. {T}he
	fact that the list of populations with the least deviation cause
	structure is almost exclusively confined to members of the `{W}est'
	group of {C}oale and {D}emeny may account for the lack of persistent
	deviation in this group's age patterns. {F}inally, the increasing
	importance of cardio-vascular disease and neoplasms in cause-of-death
	structures for males but not females is probably associated with
	the changing age patterns of male mortality noted by {C}oale and
	{D}emeny.},

	is about five to ten years lower than that of {F}rance as a whole.
	{A}t some point after the mid-century, the gap in each of the three
	is reduced. {H}owever, the timing of accelerated mortality reduction

	{T}he data derive from the surveys of the {H}elsinki health study,

	outcomes were self rated health as less than good and limiting longstanding
	illness. {A}ge adjusted prevalence percentages and fitted logistic
	regression models were calculated.{R}esults: {T}he individual effects
	of social class and psychosocial working conditions on self rated
	health and limiting longstanding illness were strong among both men
	and women. {T}he relation between social class and both health outcomes
	considerably attenuated when job control was controlled for, but
	was reinforced when controlling for job demands. {C}ontrolling for
	both job control and job demands attenuated the relation between
	social class and self rated health and limiting longstanding illness
	among women, however, was reinforced among men.{C}onclusions: {A}
	substantial part of the relation between social class and health
	could be attributed to job control, however, job demands reinforced
	the relation. {A}lthough the effect of social class is mediated by
	psychosocial working conditions, both social class and working conditions

	one of the best known is that of the epidemiological transition.
	{F}ormulated by {O}mran in 1971, it describes the changes in the
	cause-of-death pattern associated with the reduction in mortality
	rates during the demographic transition. {O}mran argued that the
	second stage, "the {A}ge of {R}eceding {P}andemics", forms a transition
	between the "{A}ge of {P}estilence and {F}amine" and the "{A}ge of
	{D}egenerative and {M}an-made {D}iseases". {I}n 1986, {O}lshansky
	and {A}ult proposed adding a fourth stage to the epidemiological
	transition, with the "{A}ge of {D}elayed {D}egenerative {D}iseases".
	{H}owever, the changeovers from the second to third stages and from
	the third to fourth stages are hard to date. {I}ndeed, examination
	of the changing dispersion in life spans casts doubt on the historical
	reality of the last two stages, though it does allow the move from
	the second to following stage to be dated. {T}his article proposes
	therefore to merge {O}mran's third stage, "the {A}ge of {D}egenerative
	diseases" with {O}lshansky and {A}ult's fourth stage, "the {A}ge
	of {D}elayed {D}egenerative {D}iseases", to form a new stage, referred
	to as the "{A}ge of the {C}onquest of the {E}xtent of {L}ife", characterized
	by the fact that the fall in mortality-which continues throughout
	this stage-is associated with little or no further concentration
	of life spans.},

	{E}stonia, the {R}ussian {F}ederation and, as a western {E}uropean
	reference, {F}inland, in two periods, 1988-89 and 1998-99. {M}ethods:
	{L}ife tables were calculated in three categories: university; secondary;

  abstract = {{E}arlier studies have found large and increasing with time differences
	in mortality by education and marital status in post-{S}oviet countries.
	{T}heir results are based on independent tabulations of population
	and deaths counts (unlinked data). {T}he present study provides the
	first census-linked estimates of group-specific mortality and the
	first comparison between census-linked and unlinked mortality estimates
	for a post-{S}oviet country. {T}he study is based on a data set linking
	140,000 deaths occurring in 2001-2004 in {L}ithuania with the population
	census of 2001. {T}he same socio-demographic information about the
	deceased is available from both the census and death records. {C}ross-tabulations
	and {P}oisson regressions are used to compare linked and unlinked
	data. {L}inked and unlinked estimates of life expectancies and mortality
	rate ratios are calculated with standard life table techniques and
	{P}oisson regressions. {F}or the two socio-demographic variables
	under study, the values from the death records partly differ from
	those from the census records. {T}he deviations are especially significant
	for education, with 72-73%, 66-67%, and 82-84% matching for higher
	education, secondary education, and lower education, respectively.
	{F}or marital status, deviations are less frequent. {F}or education
	and marital status, unlinked estimates tend to overstate mortality
	in disadvantaged groups and they understate mortality in advantaged
	groups. {T}he differences in inter-group life expectancy and the
	mortality rate ratios thus are significantly overestimated in the
	unlinked data. {S}ocio-demographic differences in mortality previously
	observed in {L}ithuania and possibly other post-{S}oviet countries
	are overestimated. {T}he growth in inequalities over the 1990s is
	real but might be overstated. {T}he results of this study confirm
	the existence of large and widening health inequalities but call
	for better data.},

	risks should be an important consideration beyond their aggregate
	population effects. {W}e used comparative risk assessment methods
	to calculate the mortality effects of unsafe water and sanitation,
	indoor air pollution from household solid fuel use, and ambient urban
	particulate matter pollution in {M}exico. {W}e also estimated the
	disparities in mortality caused by each risk factor, across (counties)
	of residence and by socioeconomic status ({SES}). {D}ata sources
	for the analysis were the national census, population-representative
	health surveys, and air quality monitoring for risk factor exposure;
	systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies for
	risk factor effects; and vital statistics for disease-specific mortality.
	{D}uring 2001{Ã}¢â‚¬â€œ2005, unsafe water and sanitation, household
	solid fuel use, and urban particulate matter pollution were responsible
	for 3,000, 3,600, and 7,600 annual deaths, respectively. {A}nnual
	child mortality rates would decrease by 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 per 1,000
	children, and life expectancy would increase by 1.0, 1.2, and 2.4
	months, respectively, in the absence of these environmental exposures.
	{T}ogether, these risk factors caused 10.6% of child deaths in the
	lowest-{SES} communities (0.9 deaths per 1,000 children), but only
	4.0% in communities in the highest-{SES} ones (0.1 per 1,000). {I}n
	the 50 most-affected , these 3 exposures were responsible for 3.2
	deaths per 1,000 children and a 10-month loss of life expectancy.
	{T}he large disparities in the mortality effects of these 3 environmental

	effects of education, class, status, and income differ between men

	apparently negative effects of income inequality on population health.
	{V}arious hypotheses are identified and described that explain the
	empirically observed association between measures of income inequality
	and population health. {W}e have concluded that data from aggregate-level
	studies of the effect of income inequality on health, i.e. studies
	at the population and community (e.g. state) levels, are largely
	insufficient to discriminate between competing hypotheses. {O}nly
	individual-level studies have the potential to discriminate between
	most of the advanced hypotheses. {T}he relevant individual-level
	studies to date, all on {U}.{S}. population data, provide strong
	support for the absolute-income hypothesis, no support for the relative-income
	hypothesis, and little or no support for the income-inequality hypothesis.
	{R}esults that provide some support for the income-inequality hypothesis
	suggest that income inequality at the state level affects mainly
	the health of the poor. {T}here is only indirect evidence for the
	deprivation hypothesis, and no evidence supports the relative-position
	hypothesis. {O}verall, the absolute-income hypothesis, although >20
	years old, is still the most likely to explain the frequently observed
	strong association between population health and income inequality
	levels.},

	of population health is still regarded as a controversial issue.
	{W}e decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent
	interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. {W}e identified
	168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association
	between income distribution and population health, and classified
	them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis
	that greater income differences are associated with lower standards
	of population health. {A}nalyses in which all adjusted associations
	between greater income equality and higher standards of population
	health were statistically significant and positive were classified
	as "wholly supportive"; if none were significant and positive they
	were classified as "unsupportive"; and if some but not all were significant
	and supportive they were classified as "partially supportive". {O}f
	those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large
	majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies
	where income differences are bigger. {T}here were substantial differences
	in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality
	was measured in large or small areas. {W}e suggest that the studies
	of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in
	that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of
	social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. {W}e suggest
	three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority
	of studies. {F}irst, many studies measured inequality in areas too
	small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society;
	second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather
	than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between
	class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social
	stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily
	lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from
	the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly
	rapidly in a number of countries. {W}e finish by discussing possible
	objections to our interpretation of the findings. (c) 2005 {E}lsevier

	12.8 potential life-years per person in the population, as compared
