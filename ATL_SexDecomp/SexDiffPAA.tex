\begin{abstract}
This is important stuff!
\end{abstract}

$G$ is a bad health condition that varies as a function of time to death,
$y$ and not as a function of chronological age, $a$. However, there will still be an
apparent age function, $g'(a)$, given that $g(y)$ is regular and mortality is
sort of stable, but not really. $g'(a)$, in this case, is an aggregate based on
both mortality and the real underlying time-to-death process:
\begin{align}
g'(a) &= \frac{\int _0^\omega g(y) N(a,y) \dd y}{N(a)} \\
      &= \frac{\int _0^\omega g(y) N(a)
      \mu(a+y)\frac{\ell(a+y)}{\ell(a)}\dd y}{N(a)}\\
      &= \int _0^\omega g(y) f(y|a)\dd y
\end{align}
a little excercise we still need to do: find the $g'(a)$ that belongs to $g(y)$
in our canned example. It will be different for males and females because they
have different mortality schedules. In this case, we can make the healthy l;ife
expectancy function be based on mortality and $g'(a)$ and see what would be the
prediction if $g'(a)$ is held constant and we induce mortality improvement. The
answer is that mortality improvement will appear to increase the proportion of
remaining life expectancy that is unhealthy: also the absolute years spent
unhealthy, but the change in sex gap is maybe ambiguous (gotta check, maybe
not), depending on the changes induced.


brief interlude \ldots.
This is a simple caes of $g(y)$, but in reality morbidity often varies as a
function of both chronological and thanatological age, and we ought to have a
function $g(a,y)$.
