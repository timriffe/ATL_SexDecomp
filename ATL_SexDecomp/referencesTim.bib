	of the rising costs of medical and long-term care. {M}any studies
	have suggested a compression of morbidity in this sector, implying
	that the future care needs of elderly people will not follow the
	demographic prognoses. {M}ost of these studies have used health indicators
	based on disability, a concept that is contextually embedded. {W}e
	have taken a closer look at health-trend surveys with a focus on
	the health indicator used. {O}ur findings reveal that although disability
	measures often show improvement, there is a simultaneous increase
	in chronic disease and functional impairments�health components that
	require care resources. {T}hat is, an expansion of other health problems
	may accompany a compression of disability. {T}herefore, a concept
	of general morbidity is not sufficient when discussing health trends
	and the need for care services in the elderly population. {B}ecause
	different indicators do not show the same trends over time, we suggest
	a more refined discussion that distinguishes between different health
	components. {I}n addition, different components have different implications
	for the amount and kind of care resources needed. {I}f the current
	positive trends in disability continue, future need for social services
	and long-term care may not parallel demographic projections. {T}rends
	in disease and functional limitations seem to have taken a different
	direction, suggesting a parallel or increased need for resources
	in medical care, rehabilitation, and compensatory interventions such
	as assistive technology.},
